Follow the detailed guide in `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`

### 2. **Set Environment Variables**
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com  
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### 3. **Deploy to Netlify**

- `transactions` - All income and expenses  
- `orders` - Equipment orders and status
- `items` - Available items catalog
- `gangfund` - Base fund amount and settings

## Testing Firebase:

1. **Check Console**: Look for `🔥 Firebase Config: { projectId: "...", usingEnvVars: true }`
2. **Add Test Data**: Login as admin, add a member
3. **Verify in Firebase**: Check Firestore Database in Firebase Console
4. **Multi-device Test**: Open on two browsers, add data on one, see it appear on the other

## Demo vs Production:

- **Demo Config**: Uses fallback values, data won't persist between sessions
- **Production Config**: With real Firebase project, data persists forever

## Next Steps:

1. **Create Firebase Project** (5 minutes)
2. **Copy config to environment variables** (2 minutes)
3. **Deploy to Netlify** (1 minute)
4. **Test real-time sync** (1 minute)
